## Introduction

:coffee: Hey there! there isn't much going on here quite yet admittidly but there are a few interesting projects that I can't wait to introduce you to!

I am a developer currently situated in Europe with an increasing passion for coding and contributing to the github community. Currently I am planning out future projects, developing my javascript & React knowledge and slowly working towards designing, prototyping and coding my personal website/portfolio.
